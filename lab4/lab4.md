The invertTree function recursively swaps the left and right subtrees of each node in the binary tree.
it does this by essentially starting at the root node and then traversing down the left and right subtrees and then swapping them from left to right and vice versa,
thus inverting the tree
we can use a for loop to do this recursively


The key idea is to start from the root and recursively swap the left and right subtrees while traversing down the tree. 
This process ensures that all nodes are inverted, resulting in the desired output.
