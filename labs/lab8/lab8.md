to solve this i made a function, coinchange which calculates the value of the coins neede dto make a certain amount
I do this by basically using dynamic programming arrays to solve the problem
The coinChange function calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount using the provided coin denominations. If itâ€™s not possible to make the amount using the given coins, it returns -1.
This is a problem solved using memo-ization
