1. Red-Black Trees

These properties are:

Self-balancing is achieved by coloring each node either Red or Black.

When the tree is modified (through insertion or deletion), it is rearranged and repainted.

Key constraints:

Root is always black.

Black is the color of all NULL leaves.

Both children of a red node are black.

Every simple path from a given node to any of its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes.

Neither the path from the root to the farthest leaf nor the path from the root to the nearest leaf is longer than twice as long as the path from the root to the nearest leaf.

Time complexity for operations: O(log n).

Uses:

Red-Black Trees are employed in:

There are virtual memory managers in some operating systems that track the number of memory pages and their usage.

Programming languages like Java, C++, and Python (built-in data structures for efficient searching and sorting).
