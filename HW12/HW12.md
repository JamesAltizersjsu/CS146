Here is some pseudocode that goes over the program.
We can model this problem as a graph, where each house is a node and the pipes represent weighted edges between the nodes. 
We can also add a virtual node that represents the water source, with edges to each house weighted by the cost of building a well in that house.
The problem then becomes finding the minimum cost to connect all nodes to the virtual node. 
This can be solved using Prim's algorithm or Kruskal's algorithm, both of which are commonly used algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees (MSTs).

The implementation uses Kruskal's algorithm with a union-find data structure to efficiently find the minimum cost.
The key steps are sorting the edges by cost and then iteratively adding them while avoiding cycles. 
The time complexity remains O(E log E) due to the sorting step.
when we make a list of the sorted edges of min to max weight, we use the union find function on the edges and vertices to find the parent of each one, to match the proper 
edge to the proper node. we use a set for the parent list and  arrays for the edges and the weights as well as the houses.
def minCostToSupplyWater(n, wells, pipes):
    edges = []
    well_costs = [0] + wells
    for i in range(n):
        edges.append([0, i + 1, wells[i]])
    for pipe in pipes:
        edges.append(pipe)
    edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])

    parent = list(range(n + 1))
    total_cost = 0

    for _, u, v, cost in edges:
        root_u = find(parent, u)
        root_v = find(parent, v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            parent[root_u] = root_v
            total_cost += cost

    return total_cost

def find(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]
